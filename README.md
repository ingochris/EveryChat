# EveryChat

## Instantaneous deliberation of nearby affairs
EveryChat is a combination of Comcast's EveryBlock API and the Yik Yak API. We found that posting on [EveryBlock](http://philly.everyblock.com/) was inconvenient and inefficient, and decided that creating a real-time chat, using [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) would allow people in each neighborhood to communicate with each other quickly and effectively.  

## Dependencies

Run `bash nodesetup.sh` to install the required npm dependencies we use in our project.
